# Easy Firewall Rule Simulator

This Python project mimics the rules that a firewall applies to IP addresses.  
After generating IPs at random and comparing them to firewall rules, it determines whether to **allow** or **block** them.  

This project concept was first presented to me in a YouTube video, but I modified it in a few ways:
The rules were hardcoded into the code of the YouTube version.  
- In my version, firewall rules are loaded from an external file called `rules.txt`.  

Because you can easily edit `rules.txt` without altering the Python code, it becomes more flexible.



## ♙️ How It Operates
1. Random IP addresses (in the `192.168.1.x` range) are generated by the script.
2. It compares the generated IP to the `rules.txt` firewall rules.
3. It applies the appropriate action (`block`, `allow`, etc.) if the IP matches a rule.
4. **allow** is the default action if no rule matches.

To specify your firewall rules, edit rules.txt.

An example of output
IP:192.168.1.0,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.19,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.19,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.11,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.7,Action:block IP:192.168.1.12,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.19,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.16,Action:allow IP:192.168.1.16,Action:allow

A YouTube tutorial served as inspiration.(https://www.youtube.com/@faanross)
I updated it with rules.txt to support external rules.
